<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

analyzeGC was built for educational and research purposes for checmical
ecology. The objective was to provide a tool set for using R to analyze
GC, and in particular GC-MS (GC coupled with Mass-spectrometry) data, to
establish a standardized and reproducible workflow.

The package relies on the
[GCalignR](https://github.com/mottensmann/GCalignR) package for the
alignment of GC peaks data across samples, based on the retention time
of the peaks.

# install.packages("devtools")
