\title{Add empty peak rows to an aligned data frame}
\usage{
add_empty_peaks(aligned_df, empty.peaks)
}
\arguments{
\item{aligned_df}{aligned area/RT data frame, as obtained with area_df or RT_df functions.}

\item{empty.peaks}{List with instructions for adding empty peaks to the data frames.

The names of the list entries correspond to the name of a sample present
in the aligned data frame, to use as reference. The function only add a peak
to the data frame, if finds the reference sample within it.
This facilitates the usage of the function on a list of aligned data frames
with lapply, as the function will add the empty peaks to the correct aligned
data frame within the list.

The entries of the list should correspond to data.frames/tibbles with two
columns ("position.reference" and "direction"). Position.reference
indicates where the empty peak should be added to the aligned data frame.
The position reference indicate a peak (e.g. P10) as a location reference
within the aligned data frame. Direction ("before" or "after") indicates
whether the empty peak should be created as the row before or after the
reference peak.}
