\title{Plot to evaluate peak alignment}
\usage{
diagnostic_heatmap(data, title, alignment.type)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{The function can receive different data types from which to produce the
diagnostic plot:

Aligned data, as obtained from align_chromatograms2, for which you want to
evaluate its alignment. In this case, it calls area_norm to normalize
the aligned area data frame before producing the plot.

An aligned data.frame of normalized abundance (area), as obtained from
area_norm.

A corrected aligned data.frame as obtained from correct_alignment.}

\item{title}{Character string with the text for the title of the plot}

\item{alignment.type}{A character string indicating the type of alignment
("automatic" or "corrected") the data comes from.

automatic: Aligned data as obtained via align_chromatograms2, with or without
normalizing it via area_norm.

corrected: A corrected area data.frame, as obtained from correct_alignment.}
}
\description{
Heatmap + dendrogram of the chemical composition of samples within an aligned
data frame.

It uses gplots::heatmap.2 to produce the plot.

If the received data frame contains only on sample, it returns a heatmap,
using ggplot2

The data is transformed to the log(1 + x) before plotting, so the difference
between peaks with low abundance values (i.e x >= 5%) is observable.
