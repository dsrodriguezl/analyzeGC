\arguments{
\item{data2align}{Dataset containing peaks that need to be aligned and matched.}

\item{linear_shift_criteria}{Numeric value indicating the size range within the linear shift of peaks can
occur during the initial full alignment step.}

\description{
Custom function for aligning chromatograms.
It is a wrapper around GCalignR::align_chromatograms function, thus it is
recommended to check its documentation (?GCalignR::align_chromatograms).

Its main purpose is to facilitate the usage of the
function with lapply, and within portable scripts.

It sets a seed before applying using GCalignR::align_chromatograms.

The name of the alignment criteria parameters are more similar to their
description in the original paper on the GCalignR package.

rt_col_name is set to "RT" by default, as it is the name given by
import_gcms_data.
