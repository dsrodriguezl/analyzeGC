\title{Normalize aligned area data frame}
\usage{
area_norm(aligned_data)
}
\arguments{
\item{aligned_data}{An aligned data set as produced by align_chromatogram2}
}
\description{
Function to normalize the aligned area data frame produced by
align_chromatograms2.

It is a wrapper around GCalignR::norm_peaks.

It facilitates the usage of the function with lapply, but its main purpose
is to be called within diagnostic_heatmap.
By default set the rt_col_name to "RT", and conc_col_name to "Area".

Automatically labels each peak as P1 to Pn, where n  =  number of peaks
in the data set.
